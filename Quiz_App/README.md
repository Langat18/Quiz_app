## Quiz App

I am building Quiz Application using react and javascript. 

The application will allow users to take quizzes on various topics, display questions one by one, and show the final score at the end. I will utilize the Open Trivia Database API to fetch quiz questions and display them in a structured format.

This project is aimed at practicing integrating external APIs, managing user input, and building a responsive and visually appealing user interface. It will simulate a real-world development environment, providing valuable experience in frontend web development and deploying applications to the web.

### Functional Requirements:

Fetch Quiz Questions:

Use the Open Trivia Database API to fetch quiz questions based on user-selected topics and difficulty levels.
Display a list of available topics, such as General Knowledge, Science, History, and Entertainment.
Allow users to choose the number of questions and difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) before starting the quiz.
Quiz Interface:

Display one question at a time, with multiple-choice answers.
Allow users to select an answer and navigate to the next question.
Indicate whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect after submission (optional).
Keep track of the user’s score throughout the quiz.
Final Score and Review:

Display the user’s final score at the end of the quiz, along with a summary of correct and incorrect answers.
Optionally, provide explanations for the correct answers (if available in the API response).
Allow users to retake the quiz or choose a different topic.
Quiz History and Performance:

Display a history of quizzes taken by the user, including scores and topics.
Optionally, implement a performance tracking feature to show progress over time (e.g., average score, best score).
Search Functionality:

Implement a search bar that allows users to search for quiz topics or keywords.
Handle cases where no topics or questions match the search query by displaying a user-friendly message.
Responsive UI Design:

Use Tailwind CSS to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).
Ensure the quiz interface is easy to navigate and visually appealing on all devices.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling for scenarios such as network issues, invalid API responses, or no quiz questions available.
Display user-friendly messages or alerts when errors occur.

### Technical Requirements:

Project Setup:

Set up a React project using tools like vite or configure a custom setup.
Install and configure TailwindCSS for styling, or use another CSS framework if preferred.
API Integration:

Use fetch or axios to request data from the Open Trivia Database API and handle asynchronous data fetching.
Display the fetched quiz data in a structured and visually appealing format.

User Interface Components:

Create reusable components for the quiz interface, question display, and score summary, such as QuizStart, QuestionCard, and ScoreSummary.
Design a cohesive layout using TailwindCSS, ensuring consistency in colors, typography, and spacing.

State Management:

Use React’s state management hooks (useState and useEffect) to handle data fetching, user input, and UI updates.
Optionally, explore more advanced state management tools like Zustand, Redux or mobx-state-tree if the application grows in complexity.

Deployment:

Deploy the completed application on a free hosting platform like Netlify or Vercel.
Ensure the application is accessible and performs well in the deployed environment.
Share the deployment link as part of your project submission.
